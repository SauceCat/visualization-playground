# Dear Data D3 implementation
Visualization: https://saucecat.github.io/visualization-playground-site/dear_data/

Dear Data is a year-long, analog data drawing project by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, two award-winning information designers. 
Each week they decide a topic about themselves, collect data points and implement data visualization ideas.

Dear Data Project inspires me a lot, it reminds me of the natural beauty behind the data about ourselves. 
Collecting personal data encourages us to focus on the daily nuance we might otherwise ignore. 
As individuals, we should be able to own our data and make independent decisions about its usage. 
While Giorgia and Stefanie show us the magic of data drawing, as a data scientist and engineer, 
I am trying to implement some of those great visualization ideas using D3.js, one of my favorite open-source libraries.

The motivation behind is quite simple though. 
1. I love Dear Data, I just can't help do something about it.
2. I love d3.js and data visualization in general, I just can't help do something about it.
3. I want to practice my d3 skill by developing data visualization projects from scratch.
4. Transforming human processes into reusable codes is always fascinating to me. Not to mention I can set variables and adjust the layout and design. 
5. Everyone can get a quick taste of the idea behind Dear Data by collecting and visualizing their data if the visualization process has been turned into codes.
